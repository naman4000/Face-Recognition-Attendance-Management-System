ðŸŽ‰Excited to Share My Minor Project: Face Recognition Attendance Management System!  

I'm thrilled to showcase my recent project, a **Face Recognition Attendance Management System**, developed as part of my academic journey. This project integrates cutting-edge technologies like **OpenCV**, **Python**, and **Machine Learning**, showcasing the potential of facial recognition in real-world applications.  

### ðŸŒŸ **Key Features**:
âœ… Real-time face detection and recognition  
âœ… Automated attendance tracking  
âœ… User-friendly interface for efficient management  
âœ… Scalable for different environments like schools, offices, or events  

This project was a great opportunity to enhance my understanding of image processing, pattern recognition, and database integration. It also improved my problem-solving and project management skills.
